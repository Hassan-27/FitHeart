🫀 FitHeart (Heart Disease Prediction)

A machine learning-powered web app built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. The app not only gives a prediction but also provides risk factors, protective insights, and confidence levels to make the results more interpretable.


📌 Features

🔍 Heart disease prediction using a trained ML model (.pkl).

📊 Probability-based results with confidence levels.

🧾 Risk and protective factor analysis for better interpretation.

🖥️ User-friendly Streamlit UI with sliders, dropdowns, and grouped inputs.

🛑 Disclaimer included to highlight the educational purpose of the tool.


🧠 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit (UI)

pandas, numpy (data handling)

joblib (model serialization)


📊 Dataset

The app uses a heart disease dataset (heart.data) with features like:

Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol

Chest Pain Type (cp), ECG Results (restecg), Exercise Induced Angina (exang)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach), Oldpeak, Thalassemia, etc.
